- Per-endpoint rate limits configured:
  - Login: 5 requests/minute
  - Registration: 3 requests/minute
  - AI endpoints: 20 requests/minute
  - Payment endpoints: 10 requests/minute
  - Default: 100 requests/minute
- Burst protection (10-second windows)
- IP blocking for repeated violations
- Rate limit headers in responses

### 3. Input Validation ✅
**Location:** `/backend/security/validation.py`
- Comprehensive Pydantic models for all endpoints
- SQL injection pattern detection and sanitization
- XSS prevention through HTML escaping
- Path traversal prevention
- File upload validation

- Email format validation
- Password strength validation

### 4. CSRF Protection ✅
**Location:** `/backend/security/middleware.py`

- Exemptions for webhooks and auth endpoints

### 5. Request Validation Middleware ✅
**Location:** `/backend/security/middleware.py`
- Request size limits per endpoint type
- Malicious pattern detection in URLs and headers
- Query parameter validation

### 6. Comprehensive API Logging ✅
**Location:** `/backend/main.py`
- All requests logged with IP addresses
- Security-sensitive endpoint monitoring
- Response status tracking
- Duration metrics
- Failed authentication alerts
- Server error tracking
- Log file: `api_security.log`

### 7. Environment-Based Security Configuration ✅
**Location:** `/backend/security/config.py`
- Development/Staging/Production configurations
- Environment-specific:
  - CORS origins
  - Rate limits
  - Session settings
  - Password policies
  - JWT expiration times
  - File upload limits

### 8. Enhanced Payment Security ✅
**Location:** `/backend/app/routes/payments.py`
- Validated payment models with amount limits
- Pattern validation for Stripe IDs
- Email validation for customer data
- Metadata size limits
- Secure webhook handling

## Security Architecture

```
Request Flow:
1. Client Request

7. Input Sanitization
8. Route Handler
9. Response Logging
10. Security Headers Added to Response
```

## Production Readiness Checklist

### Immediate Deployment Ready ✅
- [x] Security headers configured
- [x] Rate limiting active
- [x] Input validation on all endpoints
- [x] CSRF protection enabled
- [x] Request logging implemented
- [x] Environment-based configuration

### Recommended Before Production
- [ ] Set up Redis for distributed rate limiting
- [ ] Configure Sentry or similar for error tracking
- [ ] Enable SSL/TLS certificate pinning
- [ ] Implement API key rotation system
- [ ] Set up security monitoring alerts
- [ ] Configure WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- [ ] Implement database query monitoring
- [ ] Enable audit logging for admin actions

## Testing Recommendations

### Security Tests to Run
1. **Rate Limiting Test:**
   ```bash
   for i in {1..10}; do curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login -d '{}'; done
   ```

2. **Input Validation Test:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/payments/create-payment-intent \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"amount": -100}'
   ```

3. **Security Headers Test:**
   ```bash
   curl -I http://localhost:8000/api/health
   ```

4. **CSRF Test:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ai/chat \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"messages": []}'
   ```

## Configuration Instructions

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Security
ENVIRONMENT=production  # or development, staging
CSRF_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-jwt-secret-here

# Rate Limiting (for Redis - optional)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Monitoring
LOG_LEVEL=WARNING  # for production
ALERT_EMAIL=security@flowbotz.com
```

### Production Deployment Steps
1. Set `ENVIRONMENT=production` in environment variables
2. Generate strong secret keys for CSRF and JWT
3. Configure proper CORS origins in security/config.py
4. Set up SSL certificates
5. Configure reverse proxy (nginx/Apache) with security headers
6. Enable monitoring and alerting
7. Set up log aggregation
8. Configure backup and disaster recovery

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Failed login attempts per IP
- 4xx/5xx error rates
- Request latency percentiles
- Rate limit violations
- CSRF token failures
- Unusual traffic patterns
- Database query times

### Log Analysis Patterns
```bash
# Monitor failed authentications
grep "401" api_security.log | tail -20

# Check rate limit violations
grep "429" api_security.log | tail -20

# Security-sensitive endpoint access
grep "Security-sensitive" api_security.log | tail -50

# Server errors
grep "ERROR" api_security.log | tail -20
```
