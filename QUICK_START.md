# 🚀 FlowBotz Quick Start Guide

## Prerequisites

./start-frontend.sh
# OR
npm run dev:frontend
```

#### Backend Only
```bash
./start-backend.sh
# OR
npm run dev:backend
```

## 📱 Access Your Application

- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000 (FastAPI)
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs

## 🛑 Stop Services

```bash
./stop-flowbotz.sh
# OR
npm run stop
```

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

The startup scripts will help you set up environment files, but make sure to update them with your actual API keys from the original project.
